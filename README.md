# simpleTicTacToe
A simple console game of Tic Tac Toe (or Noughts and Crosses if you are Australian like me) written in C#. I've made this game before but this time I wanted to make the most well-written version I could :)

If you'd like to use my code for any reason, feel free to. No need for attribution, but I hope it helps you learn :) 

Happy coding!
