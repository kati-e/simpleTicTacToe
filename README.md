# simpleTicTacToe

A simple console game of Tic Tac Toe written in C#. I've made this game before but this time I wanted to make the most well-written version I could.

I used Visual Studio and .NET to compile/execute.

Version 1: Completed!

This initial version was just getting the essential requirements done.
- Draw/update the board on each turn
- Users can input their selection each turn to play
- The user's piece will appear in whichever space they choose on the turn
- When there is 3 of the same pieces in a row the game ends
- When there are no more spaces left the game ends

Version 2: Future Improvments - TBC

I plan to add some improvements to this little application in the future. I've listed these improvements below:
- Allowing users to choose to 'restart' or 'quit' once the game is over
- Adding ability for users to 'restart' or 'quit' at any time during the game
- Adding ability for users to 'save' and 'reload' the game later to keep playing (Closing & Reopening app)
- Adding ability for players to input names at the start of the game, and have these display within the game header, as well as in any of the winning condition messages
- Adding a 'best out of 3', 'best out of 6' & 'best out of 12' option at the start of the game that allows for a longer, and more fun game experience
- Adding a 'help' menu which can be accessed at any time throughout the game to display the rules and the controls to users

If you are looking at my repo, I hope you enjoyed or learnt something :)

Happy coding!
